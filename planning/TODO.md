# TODO
- switch to a breadth first search algorithm and measure cpu time
- add redis cache to memoize functions?? 
  - redis cant be serverless. Might want to evaluate cost first
- try writing a snake that doesn't use a tree search and uses different algos for different stages of the game
# IN PROGRESS
- customize head and tail
- add voronoi evaluator
# DONE
- try increasing the search depth depending on number of snakes
  - FAILED depth of 10 vs 6 makes 0 noticeable difference in a 1v1
